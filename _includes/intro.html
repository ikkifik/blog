        Hi, I am <span class="author-highlight">Fikri</span> a <i>self-proclaimed</i> Researcher because for the past year I spent lots of my time to do research. I have involved on some <a href="/project">papers</a> while joining some research group during my undergraduate study at <a href="https://home.amikom.ac.id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="collaborator-highlight">Purple Campus</a>.
