      <b>Sugeng rawuh!</b> (javanese: Welcome!). I'm an undergraduate researcher. I've been working on a research project as a full-time researcher while studying at the <a href="https://home.amikom.ac.id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="profile-link">Purple Campus</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I'm collaborating with <a href="https://derrywijaya.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="profile-link">Prof. Derry Wijaya</a> of Boston University, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.id/citations?user=k4WDIFcAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="profile-link">Dr. Kumara Ari Yuana</a>, and <a href="https://ariflaksito.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="profile-link">Dr. (Cand.)

      This project as part of the <span class="collaborator-highlight">US-Indonesia Research Collaboration Program</span>.

      Previously, I was fortunate to work with <a href="https://www.kusrini.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="profile-link">Prof. Kusrini</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=LH34CyEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="profile-link">Dr. Arief Setyanto</a>, and <a href="https://silvanus.amikom.ac.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several other researchers</a> on a research project named <a href="https://silvanus-project.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="profile-link">SILVANUS</a>. Funded by the European Horizon program in 2020, this project's main goal is to <span class="collaborator-highlight">manage wildfires by leveraging an integrated technological and information platform</span>.

    <p>Prior to that, I worked as a Data Engineer for a Big Data Solutions Company in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. My primary task was handling data flows from upstream to downstream.</p>
