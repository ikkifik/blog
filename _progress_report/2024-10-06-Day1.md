I found a site made by lelouch that one of his [articles](https://lelouch.dev/blog/august-2024/documenting-your-grind/) inspired me to make this kind of progress report. Yet, to make a difference I changed the title it a little bit from "Progress Report" to "Grind Report."  

To begin with, I started to learn English by using [Jeya's Club](https://jeyasclub.carrd.co/) learning modules. I have done the first part and this time I began the second part. So each part targeted to be completed in about 30 days for 30 chapters, but I targeted to accomplish it only in ~15 days. I'm going to include my English learning progress here in order to practice my English writing skill as well.  

For the experiences, I felt not really good, the temperature somewhat feels hot yet humid. It gets worse since my wall fan is under reparation. I also got bothered by mosquitos, I dunno, it hasn't rained yet but there is a lot of mosquitos flying around. However, I try to keep with it just to prove to my self that I can do it.  

Hope in the next days and further, I can keep writing my grind report.
